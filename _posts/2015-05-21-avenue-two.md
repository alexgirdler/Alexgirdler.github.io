Today was the day that we went out apartment hunting. The first place we went to was a bust with not a single opening, however the next place we rushed to to make sure that we didn't miss our chance at getting the apartment. We walked in and immediately went on a tour to see the apartment and soon after walking in I knew that was where I wanted to live. We talked with Justin and applied for a lease. After applying for a lease we took a surprise trip to Man Crates to show Pa around the warehouse and got him the t-shirt he asked for for the entire week before the trip. Once he finally got the shirt he wanted we made our way over to Ikea in order to get lost once on the way in, three times while we were in there and once finally when we tried to leave.

After everything we did today we headed back to the hotel room for a well deserved rest. Tomorrow we will be picking up all of the furniture from Ikea and moving into the apartment.

Just now got back to the hotel and ordered some pizza for a well deserved dinner. We were supposed to have been here over two hours ago but due to the weather in SF we got to sit in the airplane for two hours. After landing we got our bags and got on the shuttle... to the wrong hotel. When we got back to the airport we got into the next shuttle which apparently was guest drove by Jimmy Johnson, pretty sure we hit 70 coming down E. Grand Ave to the hotel. Once we got settled into the hotel and the pizza arrived Pa managed to drop pizza on the bed 4 times and twice on the floor in the span of two minutes.

Stay tuned, there is more to come and tomorrow we'll be looking for an apartment.

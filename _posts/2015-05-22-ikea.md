Picking up where we left off yesterday we headed to the leasing office to sign the final papers and get the keys to my new place so we could start moving into it. We then headed back over to Ikea but this time with a little greater sense of where everything was. After spending two hours writing down everything we needed, we headed to the warehouse part to actually pick it out. The store was huge and we even got lost in it the second day we were there. We filled up two carts worth of flat packs as well as a push cart full of various other items. We checked out and brought what we could back to the apartment and scheduled to have the rest of it delivered as early tomorrow as possible.

After all of that shopping at Ikea we both were completely exhausted and went to eat and then came back to the hotel. Now we just wait for tomorrow in order to build an entire apartment worth of furniture and get as much done as we can.

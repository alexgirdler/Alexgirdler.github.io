Currently writing this on the airplane from CVG(Cincinnatti) to IAH(Houston). So far the trip has gone well, aside from riding with the Bickersons to the airport. Very excited to be starting my new life out in Cali and to start working again.

This will likely be a very short post as not much has happened so far other than the actual travelling itself. Look forward to updating once I land and get settled. Can't wait to have In 'n Out once we get out to California, been missing it since I went out for BlizzCon two years ago.

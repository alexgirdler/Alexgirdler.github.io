Sorry for the late update, but I have been very busy with work and moving in to 
the apartment. Spent three days putting together Ikea furniture, something I'm
fine with if I never have to do again. My first week at work was great. Everyone 
there treats me like family and is impressed everyday by the work that I am doing.

To give you a taste of what I have been working on all week, here is a picture of it.

This is our [Travis](www.travis-ci.org) build status indicator. What travis does
is watch over our code base and any time there is a change, currently only to the 
testing repository(place where a project is hosted) is watched and in the near
future I will be adding functionality to have a build kicked off by changes to any
of the repositories that affect our website. I will probably turn this into a [ruby
gem](www.rubygems.org) so that others can benefit from my work.

Here is a quick video of the apartment I settled on.
